# Scraping app for NHK Easy article data

The purpose of this app is to grab NHK Easy articles so I don't have to copy and paste and disable furigana

# Goals/Iterations

- v1: Grab article title and body, display on screen, no furigana

- v2: Integrate WaniKani api to not remove furigana when not known on WK

- v3: Add definitions for all unknown vocab (kanji, hiragana, verbs, and katakana)
